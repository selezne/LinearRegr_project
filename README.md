# LinearRegr_project
In this project, we will try to create a linear regression model that can predict the value of real estate based on its parameters.
In the Feature engineering folder there is a notebook with preliminary cleaning and preparation of the dataset attached to it.
In the Linear regression folder there is already a notebook in which the model itself was created and tested. The same folder contains the dataset obtained during cleaning and preparation.
